# ConductorDaggerButterKnifeFlux

This is a proof of concept app for using [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor), [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/), [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife), and [Fluxion](https://github.com/nigelbro/fluxion) together.
The result is a Flux architecture app containing a single activity, no fragments, and utilizing dependency injection for the views and business logic.
